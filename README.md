C Data Structures
This repository contains implementations of various data structures in C. The data structures included are:

Dynamic Array
Stack
Based on Static Array
Based on Dynamic Array
Queue
Based on Static Array
Based on Dynamic Array
Based on Dynamic Stack (included in this repository)
Linked List
Single Linked List
Double Linked List
Each data structure is implemented as a separate module to demonstrate different concepts and techniques in data structure design and implementation.

Data Structures Overview
Dynamic Array
The dynamic array implementation provides a resizable array that automatically adjusts its size as elements are added or removed. It supports dynamic memory allocation and efficient resizing strategies.

Stack
The stack data structure follows the Last-In-First-Out (LIFO) principle. The stack implementations included are based on both static arrays and dynamic arrays, showcasing different approaches to managing stack operations.

Queue
The queue data structure follows the First-In-First-Out (FIFO) principle. Similar to the stack, queue implementations are provided based on static arrays, dynamic arrays, and dynamic stacks, highlighting various methods of implementing queues.

Linked List
The linked list implementations cover both single linked lists and double linked lists. These structures use pointers to connect elements, allowing for efficient insertion, deletion, and traversal operations.

Getting Started
To use the data structures in your projects:

Clone this repository to your local machine.
Navigate to the desired data structure directory (e.g., Stack/StaticArray).
Include the necessary header files and source files in your C project.
Use the provided API functions to interact with the data structures.
