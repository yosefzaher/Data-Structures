Data Structures in C
This repository contains implementations of various data structures in the C programming language. The following data structures are included:

Dynamic Array
Stack (based on static array, based on dynamic array)
Queue (based on static array, based on dynamic array, based on dynamic stack)
Linked List (single, double)
Each data structure has its own directory containing the implementation files and a README file with a detailed explanation and visualization.

Dynamic Array
A dynamic array is an array with a variable size. It allows elements to be added or removed as needed, and the array will automatically resize itself to accommodate the new elements.

Stack
A stack is a Last-In-First-Out (LIFO) data structure. It has two main operations: push (add an element to the top of the stack) and pop (remove the top element from the stack).

Stack (based on static array)
This implementation uses a fixed-size array to store the elements of the stack.

Static Array Stack Visualization

Stack (based on dynamic array)
This implementation uses a dynamic array to store the elements of the stack, allowing it to grow and shrink as needed.

Queue
A queue is a First-In-First-Out (FIFO) data structure. It has two main operations: enqueue (add an element to the end of the queue) and dequeue (remove the front element from the queue).

Queue (based on static array)
This implementation uses a fixed-size array to store the elements of the queue.

This implementation uses a dynamic array to store the elements of the queue, allowing it to grow and shrink as needed.

Queue (based on dynamic stack)
This implementation uses a stack (based on a dynamic array) to store the elements of the queue.

Linked List
A linked list is a linear data structure where each element is a separate object, containing a data part and a reference to the next element in the list.

Single Linked List
This implementation uses a single linked list, where each element has a reference to the next element in the list.

Single Linked List Visualization

Double Linked List
This implementation uses a double linked list, where each element has a reference to both the next and previous elements in the list.
