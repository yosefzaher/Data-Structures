Introduction
This repository aims to provide comprehensive implementations of essential data structures in C. Understanding and implementing these data structures are fundamental to writing efficient and organized code.


Dynamic Array
The dynamic array implementation provides a resizable array that automatically adjusts its size as elements are added or removed. It supports dynamic memory allocation and efficient resizing strategies.


Stack
The stack data structure follows the Last-In-First-Out (LIFO) principle. The stack implementations included are based on both static arrays and dynamic arrays, showcasing different approaches to managing stack operations.

Static Array Stack
The static array stack is implemented using a fixed-size array. It is suitable for scenarios where the maximum capacity is known in advance.


Dynamic Array Stack
The dynamic array stack uses a resizable array to handle stack operations. It dynamically adjusts its size to accommodate new elements, offering flexibility and efficient memory management.


Queue
The queue data structure follows the First-In-First-Out (FIFO) principle. Similar to the stack, queue implementations are provided based on static arrays, dynamic arrays, and dynamic stacks, highlighting various methods of implementing queues.

Static Array Queue
The static array queue uses a fixed-size array to manage queue operations. It is suitable for scenarios with a predefined maximum capacity.


Dynamic Array Queue
The dynamic array queue employs a resizable array for queue operations. It dynamically adjusts its size to handle varying numbers of elements efficiently.


Dynamic Stack Queue
The dynamic stack queue utilizes a dynamic stack internally to implement the queue. This approach combines the benefits of both stacks and queues for optimized performance.


Linked List
The linked list implementations cover both single linked lists and double linked lists. These structures use pointers to connect elements, allowing for efficient insertion, deletion, and traversal operations.

Single Linked List
The single linked list consists of nodes connected by pointers, where each node contains data and a pointer to the next node in the sequence.


Double Linked List
The double linked list extends the single linked list by including a backward pointer in each node, enabling bidirectional traversal and operations.
